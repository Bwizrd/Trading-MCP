# Trading Optimizer MCP Server Development Progress

## Codebase Patterns

### MCP Server Structure
- All MCP servers follow pattern: `@app.list_tools()` and `@app.call_tool()`
- Use `mcp.server.Server` class with stdio_server for communication
- Tools return list[TextContent] with formatted output
- Located in `mcp_servers/` directory
- Configuration added to `mcp.json` at project root

### API Integration Patterns
- VPS API base URL: `http://localhost:8020` for tick data
- Deals API base URL: `http://localhost:8000` for closed positions
- Use `httpx.AsyncClient` for async HTTP requests
- Always set reasonable timeouts (30s for API calls)
- Handle API errors with try-catch and return user-friendly messages

### Tick Data Handling
- Endpoint: `GET /getTickDataFromDB?pair={id}&startDate={iso}&endDate={iso}&maxTicks={n}`
- Ticks contain: timestamp (ms), bid, ask, spread
- Calculate mid price: `(bid + ask) / 2`
- Always sort ticks chronologically: `sorted(ticks, key=lambda t: t['timestamp'])`
- Default maxTicks: 300000 (covers full trading day for most symbols)

### Trade Simulation Logic
- BUY direction: SL triggers if `price <= entry - sl_pips`, TP if `price >= entry + tp_pips`
- SELL direction: SL triggers if `price >= entry + sl_pips`, TP if `price <= entry - tp_pips`
- Use tick mid price for execution simulation
- Track exact exit time and price from ticks
- Return result as: TradeResult.WIN, TradeResult.LOSS, TradeResult.NONE

### Trailing Stop Implementation
- Activate when profit reaches `activation_pips`
- Trail price by `trail_distance_pips`
- BUY: Track highest high, exit if price drops by trail distance
- SELL: Track lowest low, exit if price rises by trail distance
- Never move trailing stop against profit (lock in gains)

### HTML Report Generation
- Save reports to `data/optimization_reports/` directory
- Filename format: `{symbol}_{date}_{timestamp}.html`
- Include: summary statistics, trade-by-trade table, visual charts
- Use simple HTML/CSS or Jinja2 templates for generation
- Return absolute file path for user to open in browser

### Data Connector Reuse
- Leverage existing `shared/data_connector.py` for tick data fetching
- Use `DataConnector.get_market_data()` with `use_tick_data=True`
- Tick-to-candle conversion already implemented
- Symbol ID mapping available via `/symbols` endpoint

### Error Handling
- Wrap all API calls in try-catch blocks
- Validate parameters before making calls (dates, pips, symbols)
- Log errors to `logs/trading_optimizer.log`
- Return `TextContent` with ❌ emoji for user-facing errors
- Use specific exception types where possible

### Logging Conventions
- Use Python `logging` module
- Log level: INFO for operations, DEBUG for detailed trace
- Format: `%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s`
- File: `logs/trading_optimizer.log` (auto-create directory)
- Console: Also log to stderr for debugging

### Testing Approach
- Test with real endpoints: http://localhost:8020 and http://localhost:8000
- Use recent dates (2026-01-19, 2026-01-20) for testing
- Test symbols: US500_SB, UK100_SB (indices available in database)
- Verify SL/TP logic with known trades
- Test edge cases: no positions, no ticks, invalid parameters

## Development History

(Agent will append progress entries here after completing each user story)

---

## 2026-01-20 - TM-001
- Created base MCP server structure for Trading Optimizer
- Implemented health_check tool to verify server status
- Added server configuration to mcp.json
- Created comprehensive README documentation

**Files changed:**
- mcp_servers/trading_optimizer_mcp.py (new)
- mcp_servers/README_TRADING_OPTIMIZER.md (new)
- mcp.json (added tradingOptimizer server)
- agents/prd.json (marked TM-001 as passes: true)

**Learnings:**
- MCP server pattern: @app.list_tools() returns Tool objects, @app.call_tool() handles execution
- stdio_server provides async read/write streams for MCP protocol communication
- Health check tools are essential for verifying server connectivity and status
- Logging should go to both file (logs/trading_optimizer.log) and stderr for debugging
- Tool names use snake_case, descriptions should be clear and actionable
- TextContent responses format server output for the client

## 2026-01-21 - TM-002
- Implemented fetch_closed_positions tool in Trading Optimizer MCP server
- Added httpx library for async HTTP requests to deals endpoint
- Parses deal data to extract closed positions with entry/exit details
- Filters out entry-only deals, returns only completed trades
- Calculates statistics: win rate, total P/L, winning/losing trade counts
- Validates date format (YYYY-MM-DD) with clear error messages
- Handles API errors: timeout (30s), HTTP status errors, connection failures

**Files changed:**
- mcp_servers/trading_optimizer_mcp.py (added fetch_closed_positions)
- requirements.txt (already had httpx>=0.25.0)
- agents/prd.json (marked TM-002 as passes: true)

**Learnings:**
- Deals API returns ALL deals including entry and exit separately
- Only deals with "closePositionDetail" are complete trades (exits)
- tradeSide: 1=SELL, 2=BUY (reverse of intuition)
- executionTimestamp is in milliseconds, need to divide by 1000 for datetime
- Position details: entryPrice in closePositionDetail, exitPrice in main deal
- httpx.AsyncClient with timeout prevents hanging on API failures
- Format error messages with endpoint URL for debugging
- Show first 10 positions in output, indicate if more exist
